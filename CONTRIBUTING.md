# Development

## About TypeScript Support

Currently, this is still a common js module or library. We provide typescript definitions only.

Please make sure to run following for updating the typescript definition files accordingly.

```shell
npx grunt makeDts
```

# Tests

## How to write a new test case

As output from system ping varied on languages and OS, our parser may fail
on new languages or OS. To improve the correctness and coverage for this
module, we need to gather output from those system pings.

### Upload a fixture about system ping

Suppose you are using `macos` in language `en`, you have a problem for running
our module. Please upload a capture of your system ping in folder
`test/fixture/$OS/$LANGUAGE`. In this case, the name of folder will be
`test/fixture/macos/en`

### Write expected answer in answer.json

NOTE: we recommend to use [this online editor][1] for editing the content for
`answer.json`

To verify the correctness of our module on your new fixture, please provide
the expected answer in `test/fixture/answer.json`.

Format of the key name is `$OS_$LANGUAGE_$FILENAME`. In our case, this is
`macos_en_sample1`.

Value of that key should be the result from our command.

## Running test cases

We trust tested codes. Please run below command for testing before sending
a pull request

```
$ grunt test
```

## Running ipv6 test cases

As #67 introduces ipv6 mechanism, fixture file names with `v6` will enable v6.
Please refer to window/de/v6_sample.txt for an example
